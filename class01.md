## How the web works

> In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

### comments in html

>If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser

~~~~
<!-- comment goes here -->
~~~~
### id Attribute

>It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page

~~~~
<p id="pullquote"> text goes here </p>
~~~~

### Class Attribute

>rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.

~~~~
<p class="important"> text goes here .</p>
~~~~

### Block elements 
>Examples of block elements are:
~~~~
<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.
~~~~

### inline elements

>Examples of inline elements are
~~~~
<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>.
~~~~

### <div> element

> The `<div>` element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.

### <span> element 

>The `<span>` element acts like an inline equivalent of the `<div>`
element. 
The most common reason why people use `<span>` elementsis so that they can control the
appearance of the content of these elements using CSS.

### <iframe> element
> An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.

### <meta> element
>The `<meta>` element lives inside the `<head>` element and contains information about that
web page.

### escape characters

> Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
